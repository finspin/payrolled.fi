                <p>Many successful companies, including Buffer, Whole Foods Market, Sum All and plenty of others have
                    switched to open salary policy. Joel Gascoigne, CEO and co-founder of Buffer said that "the company
                    has never been able to find great people this quickly in the past." (<a

                <p>We asked a community of people who work with software the following question:&nbsp;<strong>
                    <mark>Are you more likely to apply for a job that discloses salary upfront?</mark>
                </strong></p>
                <p>Overwhelming majority replied positively, here are some of the answers:</p>

                    <blockquote>Certainly. Especially right now, you need to attract candidates who are "passively
                        looking": people who have a job, but would move given a good offer. I do freelance development
                        and consulting, and I'm basically happy with that. I wouldn't turn down a great opportunity, but
                        I'm not going to start the application process unless I know you can beat what I'm already
                        earning.

                    <blockquote>More than once I've gotten to the negotiation phase of the job offer only to find the
                        employer won't meet my salary requirement. It's very frustrating and a huge waste of time for
                        everyone.

                    <blockquote>Of course, one of my terrible experiences was interviewing after a company pinged and
                        showed strong interest. Only to be offered half of what I was making and been begged to take it
                        because they are about to go big and shares. I wish to know the salary upfront. I'll never take
                        another interview without discussing the salary range beforehand.

                    <blockquote>For the most part, yes. Given that job titles aren't able to help me discover whether an
                        opportunity is right for my next career move, salary ranges help me to gauge whether I'd be
                        moving up a ladder and save me time from having to schedule something only to find out that they
                        were really looking for juniors.

                    <blockquote>Having a clear salary expectation up front just saves both parties time and effort. One
                        of the big reasons salary ranges aren't always public, is because it benefits the company, by
                        maintaining information asymmetry. By but doing that, you're at least in a small way, telling me
                        that you don't want to play that game and are more likely to be transparent with me about other
                        parts of the process.

                    <blockquote>I have also been interviewed for roles where the salary being offered is substantially
                        below market value. What a waste of time tbh.

                    <blockquote>Absolutely. There's no point in wasting either side's time applying to a company that
                        can't afford me. On the flip side, if they're got very nitpicky requirements and are offering a
                        huge salary, that's a good signal that they really are requirements and not just a description
                        of the pie-in-the-sky ideal candidate.
